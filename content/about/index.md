## This blog

To start this blog, I came up with some basic guiding principles:
- Keep it fun and not too serious
- Progress over perfection
- Focus on learning and curiosity

Posts on this blog are meant to be concise rather than exhaustive. My goals are: 
- Learn about new topics
- Share findings on topics I find interesting
- Organize my thoughts

I’m a **Data Engineer** with a research background and work at Encavis AG in Hamburg, a company focused on renewable energy (solar and wind). 
My main interests are databases, data pipelines, and writing robust code in Python, SQL (dbt), and Rust.
My **PhD research** focused on credit risk, where I applied methods from machine learning, natural language processing, deep learning, and statistics. 

Because I enjoyed building databases and data pipelines, I chose to focus on data engineering.
This background helps me anticipate the needs of data science and business intelligence colleagues.

In addition, I’m proficient with Terraform and the Snowflake platform.
My research also took me deep into the **Python data science ecosystem** (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, statsmodels, ...).
I earned my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Business Information Systems (Wirtschaftsinformatik) at the University of Göttingen.

Topics I'm currently exploring: Rust, monetary policy in the EU and US, and recent AI research.
