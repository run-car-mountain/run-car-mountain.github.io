## This blog

To start this blog, I came up with some basic guiding principles:
- Keep it fun and and not too serious
- Progress over perfection
- Focus on learning and curiosity

The posts are not supposed to be extraordinarily extensive or in-depth. My goals with this blog are: 

- Learn about new topics
- Share findings about stuff I find interesting
- Sort and structure my thoughts

I am a **Data Engineer** with a research background and work at Encavis AG in Hamburg, Germany.
My main interests are databases, data pipelines and writing robust code (in Python, SQL or Rust).
My **PhD research** emphasized topics in the areas of machine learning, natural language processing, deep learning, finance and credit risk. 

Because I enjoyed the work on the database and data pipeline side so much, I decided to focus on data engineering work.
This gives me an interesting perspective because it helps to anticipate the needs and requirements of Data Science and Business Intelligence colleagues.

At the moment I am focusing heavily on Python, SQL and Rust.
But the research work helped me learn a lot about the **Python data science ecosystem** (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, statsmodels, ...).
I did my Bachelor's and Master's degree in Business Information Systems (Wirtschaftsinformatik) at the University of Göttingen.

Topics I currently try to learn about: *Rust, monetary policy in the EU and US, keeping up with recent AI research*
