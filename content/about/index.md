## This blog

To make start this blog, I thought about some basic guiding principles I want to try to follow:
- Keep it fun and and not too serious
- Progress over perfection
- Focus on learning and curiosity

The posts are not supposed to be extraordinarily extensive or in-depth. My goals with this blog are: 

1. Learn about new topics
2. Share findings about stuff I find interesting
3. Sort and structure my thoughts

## Me

{{< images-side-by-side "rome.jpg" "Rome" "paris.jpg" "Paris" >}}

I am a **Data Engineer** with a research background and work at Encavis AG in Hamburg, Germany.
Previously I was employed at an InsurTech startup.
In my **PhD research**, I dealt with topics such as machine learning, natural language processing, deep learning, finance and credit risk. 
Hence, I am interested in a broad range of topics. 
The **Python** language is one  and the associated **data science ecosystem** (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, statsmodels, ...). 
But I am generally interested in how to store, process and analyze data.
I did my Bachelor's and Master's degree in Business Information Systems (Wirtschaftsinformatik) at the University of Göttingen.
