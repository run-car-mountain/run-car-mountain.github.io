This page is an assortment of interesting links and ressources I collect over time.
Since I save them anyways, I thought it might be interesting to share them publicly.
I will try to update it regularly.

# Natural Language Processing and LLMs

[LLM Arena](https://chat.lmsys.org/)  
**keywords**: natural language processing, large language model, evaluation  
**comment**: Enter prompt and compare two LLMs side by side (blind). Results feed into the leadboard showing the ELO of different models.

**comment**: Goes into detail how to set up a python app to perform retrieval augmented generation (RAG) over complex PDFs.
**info**: youtube | 2023-12-07  

[Interactive LLM Visualization in Browser](https://bbycroft.net/llm)  
**keywords**: natural language processing, large language model, evaluation  
**comment**: Insanely cool visualization of the dimensions of the matrices in a transformer model. Together with the tutorial videos by Karpathy really helps to create a good intution for the structure of LLMs.

[Transformer Slide Deck by Lucas Beyer (Deepmind)](lucasb.eyer.be/transformer)  
**keywords**: natural language processing, large language model  
**comment**: Slide deck on transformer logic.

[Chunking Visualizer for RAG](https://chunkviz.up.railway.app/)

**comment**: Helps to visualize different approaches for chunking that is relevant when building RAG apps.

[BERTopic](https://maartengr.github.io/BERTopic/index.html)  
**keywords**: large language model, topic modeling, clustering  
**comment**: Topic mining library based on BERT and c-TF-IDF. Haven't used it myself but looks very promising.

[Perspectives on diffusion](https://sander.ai/2023/07/20/perspectives.html)

# Finance and Monetary System
[Zur Sinnhaftigkeit von Schuldenbremsen und Fiskalregeln by Lars Feld (IFO Institute)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwxK5Rx7Kv4)  
**keywords**: debt management, interest rates, debt brake, fiscal deficits  
**comment**: This talk lays out the basic arguments for fiscal rules in general and specifically the debt brake in Germany. Since the topic is so frequently in media and talk shows, it is quite interesting to have the pro side of this debate laid out compactly. Aspect I would have liked a few words about: Focus on nominal debt vs interest expenses against background of recent low interest environment.

[Money still matters for monetary policy presentation by Isabel Schnabel (ECB)](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2023/html/ecb.sp230925_1~7ad8ef22e2.en.html)  
[Accompanying slides](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2023/html/ecb.sp230925_1_annex~ffad9c5321.en.pdf)  
**keywords**: inflation, money supply, macroeconomics, monetary policy  
**comment**: After the recent decade of low inflation and nominal interest rates before covid, I thought it was quite interesting to read the view by the ECB on the inflation surge. Especially since it was argued in different outlets (talk shows, news papers, agencies) that the inflation was primarily a supply side shock, this analysis from the ECB seems quite balanced and acknowledges the potential inflationary pressure, depending on the regime a sovereign state is in.

[Dirk Ehnts über Staatsschulden & die Modern Monetary Theory at Jung & Naiv](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wp1j11cmHbk)  
**keywords**: monetary policy, government deficit, modern monetary theory  
**comment**: Dirk Ehnts is an advocate of modern monetary policy (MMT). In most cases I personally disagree with the assessments from advocates of the MMT school. However, I still find it interesting and valuable to follow the discussion and then come up with arguments as to why I disagree and would not recommend to follow the policy implications. Certainly the polar opposite to the lecture by Lars Feld.

[Code based illustration of the Silicon Valley Bank Failure](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15uxrAeCCL327kWH9N0X-ogKwf2zErjP5)

**keywords**: virtual reality, machine learning
**comment**: Since I am a big fan of virtual reality, the concepts of trying to digitize humans is very interesting to me.
