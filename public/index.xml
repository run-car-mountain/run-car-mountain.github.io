      <description>I have been a happy and satisfied user of generative image models such as stable diffusion, midjourney and dalle for over one year now.

While I have mainly used these models to create images of imaginary landscapes and futuristic cityscapes, I have learned to appreciate them for more productive uses recently.</description>
