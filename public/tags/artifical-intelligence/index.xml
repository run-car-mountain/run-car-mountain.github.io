      <description>I have been a happy and satisfied user of generative image models such as stable diffusion, midjourney and dalle for over one year now. Admittedly, when the outputs looked pixelated and bad, I did not get the appeal compared to discriminative models that can help with classification tasks.
While I have mainly used these models to create images of imaginary landscapes and futuristic cityscapes, I have learned to appreciate them for more productive uses recently.</description>
